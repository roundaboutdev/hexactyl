# Hexactyl

The next generation resource management dashboard for pterodactyl

---

## Features

Here are the following features I have added till date :

+ ### Auth

> - Login of existing user
> - Sign up for new user `The user also gets an account created for them in the pterodactyl panel with the same password for this dashboard`
> - ~~Discord Account Linking~~ `Didn't work out so held for later`
> - Auth protected every page except the auth pages so that no one can access the dashboard without logging in

+ ### Dashboard

    > - Can create a new server `UI done, working on functionality`
    > - Can see their owned server `UI done, working on functionality`
